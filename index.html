                <h2>Is Machining Necessary?</h2>

                <p>
                    Before diving into the nitty-gritty of CNC machining a part,
                    it is important to ask yourself if it is necessary. Often a
                    part or assembly can be designed in such a way that in-house
                    machining is greatly reduced or removed entirely from the
                    process. Some common motivaitons for machining parts
                    include:
                </p>

                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>
                        Precision features (flatness on seal faces, precision
                        holes, engineered fits)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Material strength or stiffness (aerospace, automotive)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Extreme temperature applications (rocket parts,
                        superconducting magnet parts)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    After deeming machining necessary, it is time to decide if

                    <a href="#milling" class="highlight-term">Milling</a> better
                    suits the manufacturing of the part.
                    <a href="#milling" class="highlight-term">Milling</a> is
                    well suited to parts that can be described in the cartesian
                    coordinate system such as curved shapes in a plane or 3d
                    contours.
                    <a href="#turning" class="highlight-term">Turning</a> is
                    suited more to parts that can be described in the
                    cylindrical coordinate system such as shafts or parts with a
                    cylindrical surface. When designing parts it is best
                    practice to have the manufacturing process in mind. Even
                    when 3d printing it is helpful to visualize how each of your
                    parts might be manufactured in a mill or lathe.

                        The Eldorado Bridgemill is a 3-axis CNC mill with a

                        examples of some parts that can and can't be
                        manufactured on the mill.

                        Although some parts may be theoretically possible on a
                        three axis machine, considering the availible tools is
                        just as important as the machines physical limits. To
                        simplify this process, the team has compiled a virtual
                        (and real) tool library stocked full of common tool
                        geometries and their feeds and speeds for common
                        materials. To most effectivly use this library you can
                        download it below. The tool library is built around
                        using Fusion for CAM.

                                    Now it is time to define the material (stock) that 
                                    you are using in real life virtually so that the the 
                                    machine can be programmed to remove it correctly without any crashes. 
                                    To do this, first measure the stock in real life, then click setups, new setup.

                                <p>
                                Now it is time to define the coordinate system.
                                In most cases it is convinent for the coordinate
                                system to be defined off of a stock corner as 
                                this is easy to locate with the machine in real life.
                                </p>

                                I have chosen the following coordinate system based on
                                how I envision i will hold the part in the vice on the mill. 
                                learning this comes with practice but it can be picked up quickly.

                                Now, the stock box must be defined correctly with respect to
                                the measurements of the stock in real life. There are ways around 
                                this, but it is simple to just input the actual size to avoid crashes.
                                (also remember to square up the stock before machining!)
                                </p>

                                    Now for the fun part, programming the operation to best 
                                    subtract away material from the stock as it is defined, leaving your part.
                                    For this example part, it is clear that the operation type needed for the large
                                    pocket in the middle of the part is a 2d pocket. Common operation types are 2 and 3D pocketing,
                                    boring, 2 and 3D contouring, and facing. The setup for all of the different types 
                                    is simple and clear to click through with Fusion. 
                                </p>

                                    Now it is time to select a tool for the toolpath from the tool libary.
                                    Because this pocket has a flat bottom with no chamfer on its edge, a flat end mill
                                    was chosen. The desired material to make this part is aluminum, so a two flute carbide end mill was 
                                    chosen. Click on the select button next to tool in the above image.                                        After navigating to the El Dorado tool library, select a suitable tool

                                <p>
                                    In the absense of a coolant system no coolant can be used, 
                                    so no need to uncheck this box as the coolant will never be fired off.
                                    Coolant is available on many other machines and allows for faster cycle times 
                                    and often better surface finishes.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Next, move to the geometry tab and select the feature of interest. In this case
                                    it is the lower face of the pocket. There are different ways to specify a feature 
                                    and fusion is pretty forgiving.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Now that the geometry has been selected, it is time to evaluate other parameters
                                    of the toolpath. Two important adjustments are the number of passes and 
                                    if you want to have a "finishing" pass. The default setting for a pocket operation 
                                    is for the toolpath to be completed at one depth. While this is theoretically possible 
                                    sometimes, it is not a best practice as the cutting force is high and machine and tool wear 
                                    are increased. The main issue with doing this on this machine is that the spindle motor
                                    may stall and ruin the part or you may break an end mill with too high of a cutting force.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This leaves us at the multiple depths setting to solve this issue. Typically a safe cut depth is 1-2mm
                                    for this machine and/or a new user. This can be less for harder materials such as steel and greater
                                    for softer materials such as plastics. Sometimes this value is auto-populated based on 
                                    tool data.
                                </p>

                                    Finally you can hit ok after realizing that a finishing pass is not needed for your part
                                    and then view and animate the simulated toolpath.

                                    If the part needs more than one operation to finish (like this one),
                                    then adding another operation is simple.
                                </p>

                                    Select the type of operation that is needed from the navbar menu and then 
                                    go through the dialog again. The feature of interest that was not machined
                                    with the inital pocket operation is the small "open pocket" on the bottom edge. 
                                    This feature can be machined with a 2d countour operation. 
                                </p>

                                    The steps are similar to the pocket operation: Select operation type, choose tool from
                                    tool library, choose geometry to machine, then modify features such as stepdown amount 
                                    and if there is a finishing pass.
